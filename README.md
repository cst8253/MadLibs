# Mad Libs

## Objective
Mad Libs is a fun word game where players provide types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. ) without knowing the context in which the words will be used. Those words are then placed inside a story, often with hilarious results.

Create an interactive game of Mad Libs using Blazor.
